                <p>Vela is a weather application specifically designed for water sports aficionados who want to spend their days on or near large bodies of water. It provides advanced weather information on tide, wave reports, and general weather information in an easily digestible format for people of all skill levels. Safety is of the utmost priority in order to ensure that water sports undertakers can have fun and protect themselves simultaneously.

                <h4>What's the problem?</h4>
                <p>Existing weather apps aren’t meeting the goal of displaying complex weather data in an accessible, easy-to-comprehend way to novice and advanced water sports goers.
                </p>
                <h4>Enter Vela...</h4>
                <p>
                    Where water sports lovers can quickly glance at the Home screen to check the weather at their current location, search weather at a specific location, and view overall weather at their favorite spots. Vela comes equipped with hazard warnings to ensure safety is prioritized. Users may also check the Map screen so that they may view weather in layers and detailed weather information at clickable spots on the map. We even added a Community feature so that users can connect with other water sports lovers and build a whole community!

                <p>
                    Surfline’s main distinction from other applications was its surf cameras. You could access these surf cameras only if you were a premium member. However, they proved to be a valuable tool for surfers. Since my application is more loosely based for water sports lovers of all kinds, I did not adopt this feature. However, I did appreciate their community based approach and their visual style. The brand for Surfline was strong with a clear logo and a distinct style that was easily recognizable. I did not want to emulate their complicated navigational style since it was confusing and redundant.

                    These stories kept me on track and helped me prioritize the possible needs of my users:
                </p>
                <p>
                    1. As a user, I want a Dashboard and a Home Screen so that I can view all the potential navigational options within a glance.
                </p>
                <p>
                    2. As a new user, I want to log in or sign up quickly so that I can access Vela’s features.

                <h4>
                    In order to design Vela for water sports enthusiasts, I started by…
                </h4>
                <p>
                    Interviewing three potential users that participate in water sports (surfing, sailing, and swimming) in order to decide what user needs for Vela would be. The tests were conducted remotely and users were asked 10-15 questions regarding important weather application features and other needs. ​​​​​​​ 
                </p>
                <h4>What was I attempting to accomplish? I was...</h4>
                <p>
                    1. Discovering user opinions on other applications that have similar objectives as Vela
                </p>
                <p>
                    2. Trying to understand what tasks users partake in most often and in what context/for what reason before/during water sports activities
                </p>
                <p>
                    3. Discovering general user needs and preferences when it comes to a weather related application.
                </p>
                <h4>
                    The testing produced interesting results. Overall, I learned that users...
                </h4>
                <p>
                    1. Want a simple, easy to understand application with all relevant information regarding temperature, tide conditions, safety hazards, wind, and depth. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    2. Don’t care much for bells and whistles, such as customization or extravagant design.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    3. Respond best to visual icons and graphical information.
                </p>
                <p>
                    4. Don’t want constant notifications and typically check weather on a need-to-know basis.
                </p>
                <p>
                    5. Will be mostly likely using Vela as a preventative measure. When they’re out on the water they’re not typically checking the weather.

                    In order to understand the patterns of user needs, I used a whiteboard and sticky notes to group together common points. These helped me prioritize the user needs that I should attend to first and what ideas were most prevalent in the results.

                    Shortly after, I created two personas that represented the users that I am designing for. I did an in-depth analysis of user's goals, needs, and behaviors based on my user testing and created Captain Flint and Jason Ryder.

                </picture>
                <p>
                    Captain Flint represents the more serious and focused user who depends on a weather app in order to live.

                <p>
                    Shortly after my user personas, I designed some user flows to avoid the common mistake of too much focus on individual pages and interactions within an app. Taking a step back and concentrating on user flows rather than individual pages made my design more user-centered and, therefore, more efficient.

                <p>
                    In order to build a properly organized and structured application, I built a sitemap to showcase my general ideas for Vela. After conducting a card sort on some participants, I re-organized my sitemap according to their answers:
                </p>
                <p>
                    1. I placed "Feed" in the Homepage and "Community" page and decided to see how users would respond during usability testing, though I had my doubts about the feature.
                </p>
                <p>
                    2. “Favorite Locations” and “Today’s Weather” were added to both the Home and Map screen per the sorter’s strong split between the two.
                </p>
                <p>
                    3.  “Recent Locations” was added to Map screen from sorter suggestions. I planned to add this to the search tool specifically. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    4. “Adjust Metrics” was added as a feature in Account.

                <p>
                    In order to create a clear and functional blueprint for the app’s user interface, I built wireframes. My goal was to outline the functional requirements and previously made user flows. The focus was on ease of use, accessibility, and engagement. These were one-step up from my paper and pencil wireframes. Figma was my tool of choice to showcase my ideas.

                <h4>So...what's the plan?</h4>
                <p>
                    My goal was to assess how usable Vela was for new users. Since this app is meant to allow users to digest somewhat complex information at a glance, I wanted to ensure that all accessibility and usability issues were addressed for their safety. Specifically, this centered around checking the weather, signing in/signing up, and checking the map for locations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My Objectives:
                </p>
                <p>
                    - Determine how easily users can navigate through Vela and understand the information presented to them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    - Receive feedback on what the users’ thoughts are when interacting with the application and assess through qualitative measures.
                </p>
                <h4>In other words, I was attempting to measure ease of use, clarity, and usefulness.</h4>
                <p>
                    My Methods:
                </p>
                <p>
                    The study was moderated in-person and remotely. In-person location varied based on participant location and Zoom was used for the remote meetings. First, I administered a consent form while de-briefing the subject. Then, I proceeded to list the questions that needed to be answered and the tasks that had to be done. During this process, I received critical feedback that changed Vela's design.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Participants:
                </p>
                <p>
                    The 5 participants I recruited were a mix of people from my personal network and water sports enthusiasts.
                </p>
                <h4>An unexpected turn of events...</h4>

                </picture>
                <p>
                    The usability test proved to be very useful in gaining user insights on ease of use, clarity, and usefulness. In fact, I was quite surprised with some of the errors and feedback I received regarding my task flows.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In order to organize the high volume of information I received, I created a rainbow sheet. This sheet significantly aided me in documenting errors that users made when I administered certain tasks, making observations of user behavior when interacting with Vela, and jotting down positive/negative quotes that users expressed to me.

                <p>
                    In choosing the colors, fonts, and typography of Vela, I wanted to ensure that Vela's style would match a water sports theme but also didn't distract the users too much from important weather information. I utilized Google's Material Design recommendations to ensure the best UI implementation.

                <h4>The Logo:</h4>
                <p>
                    I wanted the logo to be written in "Sail" because it matched the care-free and aesthetic nature of the app. The name of the font is a water sport which matched the theme of the app as well.
                </p>
                <h4>The Colors:</h4>
                <p>
                    ▪ The primary color is blue to ensure relaxation so that users don't feel stressed checking the weather. This color also represents the blue of the ocean.
                </p>
                <p>
                    ▪ The surface color is not #FFFFFF (pure white), and instead is #F8F9FD (a bluish-white) so as not to blind users when opening the app.
                </p>
                <p>
                    ▪ The "Hazard Warnings" and any error messages are in red to alert the user to any important information.
                </p>
                <h4>The Font:</h4>
                <p>
                    Roboto is the standard font for Google's Material Design and ensures that the standard is kept clean and easily readable. The sizing of the font is dependent on the purpose of the message.

                    The process of making Vela was not an easy one. It was fraught with rough waves, high tides, and unexpected icebergs. However, we made it to our destination! I fully plan on implementing another usability test on my most recent improvements to continuously improve Vela. I hope that I can continue to make Vela even more accessible, usable, and beautiful for all water sports lovers.
